ABU ROBOCON 2018 competition

competition objective : handling shuttlecocks and throwing them through rings.

it contains two robots:

1/ Manual robot : manual should pick shuttlecocks and handle it to automatic robot. There are two types of shuttlecocks such as normal and golden.

2/ Automatic robot : after handling shuttlecock form manual robot, it should throw the shuttlecock at the ring to gain points. If the shuttlecock is normal, automatic robot must throw it at normal rings(from different zones: zone1 and zone2). If the shuttlecock is golden, automatic robot must throw it at golden ring (zone3) and when Golden Shuttlecock is thrown through the Golden Ring and then is landed on the Golden Cup, that team will gain "Rongbay"(“Flying Dragon”) and the match will be finished.

The Robocon '18 was held in Vietnam. The final contest was between China and Vietnam where Vietnamese team emerged victorious. 
The other teams that participated were no less. They pulled some jaw droping stunts with their bots.

Let's talk about the Japanese team first. They brought the two bots named 'The girlfriend' and 'The boyfriend'. Well they were fast and smooth. The first bot 'The girlfriend' an automatic robot and the second one named 'The boyfriend' a manual robot were the stars of the show. The work of the manual robot was to pick the shuttle cock and to pass it to the automaatic robot to throw it through the target ring.
Following are the links for the images of above mentioned robots.
